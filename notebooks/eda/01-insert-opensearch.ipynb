       "    '_source': {'contents': 'The Loup-Garou Rules of the Game\\n- Franconaute Identifier\\nDate of registration: August 2005\\nLocation: Nice Messages: 9,048\\nLoup-Garou\\'s rules of play In order to attract new players for future games, I am handing over the rules, so that they can better understand the game .\\nMost of the sentences will be taken from the rules of Coelio, I would only complete some things .\\nThe rules The beginning of the game: The master of the game is embodied by the person who proposes to be the master of the game for the next game .\\nThis master of the game must, on the one hand, think about the universe in which the game will be located, and, on the other hand, open a registration list, in which people wishing to participate in the next game will have to sign up.\\nOnce the entries have been completed, the master of the game will assign the roles of each person by drawing lots.\\nYou will receive your role via private message from the game master .\\nThe characters you can portray are: sorcerer, werewolf, doctor, seer, hunter, lover .\\nThe Witch:\\nThe wizard does not appear systematically in all parts, it is usually according to the master of the game .\\nRole often decried for giving wolves too much of a disadvantage .\\nNevertheless\\nthis is to be mitigated, the wizard has two powers:\\nHe can only once in the game rekindle a person who has been killed by the wolves .\\nIt is up to him to use this power well, let\\'s note on the right person and hope not to die soon .\\nIt can only once in the game kill a person (only in the phase of the game that is called at night), that person killed can be a wolf or a simple innocent who did not ask anyone .\\nIt is the use of this power that gives wolves a huge disadvantage, but only if it is used well, which is not necessarily obvious .\\nThe werewolf: There are several, depending on the party, in general there is one wolf for every 3 villagers (villagers generally include those who are simply not wolves) .\\nThe wolf has only one goal: to kill .\\nHow to kill will be explained later in the game phase .\\nIt is clear that the wolf must not be discovered under any circumstances.\\n, lying, bluff, false asses, crookedness are appropriate for any player, but especially for wolves who will have to, whatever the means, blend into the mass and not be spotted .\\nThe Doctor: He can protect a person every night (it can also be himself) by choosing who he wants to protect and informing the master of the game by private message, just before night falls .\\nIn the event that the wolves try to kill the person the doctor has protected, the person will survive and the wolves will come home empty that night .\\nOf course, the doctor doesn\\'t know who the werewolves are going to attack, so it\\'s up to him to choose and hope that he makes the right choice.\\nIf someone asks the doctor if he is the doctor, he MUST answer yes.\\nBut the other players can also lie and say it\\'s them ...\\nThe seer : He can, just before night falls, choose to investigate a person, sending a private message to the master of the game to tell him who he wants to investigate .\\nThe game master will give him the day after the result of his investigation, telling him if the chosen person is a werewolf or not (unless the werewolves had decided to eat the seer that night).\\nThe seer can give his information to others immediately, or keep it for him .\\nIt is probably best to keep a minimum of discretion, because if the werewolves know who the seer is, he will certainly be the next to get pummelled...\\nUnlike the doctor, the seer is not obliged to say that he is the seer if asked, he can lie.\\nOther players can also lie and pretend to be the seer\\nif it sings to them .\\nAll these previous roles cannot be cumulated at all, since the doctor, the seer and the wizard are necessarily villagers.\\nNevertheless, there are roles that can be cumulated with the function of wolf, or others .\\nHunter: The hunter may, when he dies, designate to the master of the game who must die with him.\\nIt can kill anyone, whether a villager or a wolf.\\nHis attack is unassailable: neither the doctor nor the sorcerer can counter it.\\nNevertheless, he can act as a precaution by not killing anyone just before he stumbles .\\nThe hunter can be a wolf or a villager, whatever the Doctors, Seekers and Sorcerers cannot also be a hunter .\\nThe Lovers:\\nOf the players, two are \"in love\".\\nThey can be werewolves, villagers ( or 1 werewolf and 1 villager... ) in short, anyone.\\nBoth must try to protect themselves, because if one dies, so does the other.\\nSo they actually play with each other only, and both win if they are alive at the end of the game .\\nIt should be noted that a lover can combine any function (doctor, seer, hunter, wolf, etc) .\\nApart from these functions, which are determined by drawing lots, there is a final function which is elective, namely the role of mayor .\\nVoting for the mayor begins after everyone has received by private message the role he or she will play throughout the game .\\nAny player without the slightest exception can become a mayor, however it is relatively inadvisable to have a major position such as wolf, doctor, seer or sorcerer in addition to the position of mayor .\\nThe mayor: The mayor has one power: to decide who will die in the event of a tie to go to the stake (you will see in the part : phases of the game) .\\nApart from that the mayor has no specific powers, nevertheless he is admitted to be the leader for the hunting of wolves .\\nIn short, it is often up to him to direct operations in conjunction with the doctor and the seer and other villagers in order to hunt down the wolves .\\nSince the mayor has a considerable influence during the votes, we must be careful not to be too much in his sights .\\nOnce the commander\\'s vote is completed, the game finally begins: The phases of the game: There are two phases in the game: day and night .\\nIt might as well go on chronologically and mention what follows directly from the election of the mayor .\\nThe first phase begins at night:\\nAt night: Here it is really just a matter of secret dealings between the various roles of each and the master of the game.\\nIn short, three basic private messages must be sent to the master of the game (not necessarily by e-mail, by the way, just let the master of the game know your intentions, by whatever means):\\nThe wolves must indicate with one voice (so they will have to coordinate among themselves) who they wish to kill this night The doctor must indicate who he protects this night The seer must indicate who he wants to investigate this night These are the three major phases of the night, without which the night will last until the master of the game has the elements to continue the game .\\nNote that the game is well done: the night in the game generally encompasses the night in reality .\\nIn addition to these three essential elements two other falcutives can be sent: The sorcerer can indicate who he wishes to kill or rekindle this night, if he does not send an indication, the master of the game considers that he does not want to use his powers this night The hunter indicates who he wishes to kill (or if he does not wish to kill) if he had just died .\\nHe can do this every night which will help the speed of excision of the night, but is not obliged to do so while he is alive .\\nOnce the master of the game has all these elements he proclaims the 1st day: The day: The master of the game thus creates a 1st day topic, in which he usually indicates who died that night, or if simply no one died that night .\\nHe has no obligation to indicate who was protected that night, but he has an obligation to indicate the role played by the death, if he had one.\\nAlthough the night effectively lasts only one night, the day can last for as long as the master of the game decides.\\nGenerally speaking, the day ends when the vote is closed, that is one or two days, and generally it can last longer on weekends, so that everyone can express themselves.\\nBut what is this vote that I keep talking about?\\nIt is quite simply a vote, in which every player has the right to vote, and it is this vote that will determine who is sent out in a pyre .\\nSee\\nthis as part of the wolf hunt, however it is often not the wolves who end up at the stake .\\nIt is the day that is therefore the most intense moment in the confrontation between the villagers and the wolves, the isolated villagers, voting by suspicion because very often does not know who holds what role , and the wolves who do everything to kill a villager and especially not to be spotted .\\nBasically it\\'s total chaos where everyone has to pull their weight .\\nAs stated above, in the event of a tie, the mayor will decide who goes to the pyre .\\nThe master of the game therefore completes the vote by indicating the role played by the person chosen at the stake .\\nOnce the vote is closed (usually 20H or 21H, it is the master of the game who decides sovereignly) starts again the night when the seer must investigate, the doctor protect, and the wolves kill .\\nAnd so on, until the game ends .\\nThe game ends in two contexts:\\nThe wolves are all dead or have decided to surrender, the villagers take the game away .\\nThe village has as many wolves as villagers, the wolves win.\\nP.S.:\\nfinnally I didn\\'t take much back from
